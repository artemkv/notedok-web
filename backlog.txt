! Show first 5 notes

As a regular user, I want to see my first 5 notes when I load page initially

* Load list of files from the storage (async)
* Render first 5 notes (or as many as could find)
	* TODO: Only text files should be shown (filter based on file extension ".txt")
	* TODO: File name becomes a title (file extension ".txt" is omitted)
	* File content becomes a text
	* Title should be rendered as safe content
	* Text should be rendered as safe content
	* Note loading and rendering should be done asynchronously, since it might take time to retrieve the note content
	* Title is always displayed as a single line
	* Long title should be rendered with "..." at the end, replacing the hidden part
	* Long text should be all visible, the note height is variable and adjusts to fit all text


! Progress indicator

As a regular user, I want to have an understanding that the page is alive and doing something

* Render the progress indicator while file list is being retrieved


! Load next 5 notes

As a regular user, I want to see next 5 notes if the note I am interested in is not yet shown on the page

* When clicked on "More" button load next 5 notes (or as many as could find)
* Loading and rendering should be done the same as for the first 5 notes


! Number of notes yet to load

As a regular user, I feel frustrated when I only see first 5 notes and have no idea how many there are more.

* Indicate number of notes matching the current search filter and not yet loaded on the "More" button: "More (N not loaded)"





Test:
- notes loaded in a random order are rendered in the order the are returned
- start loading second page before the first page notes have finished loading
